						<h2>About Me</h2>
						<p>
							Hi! I'm Manuel, a technology consultant with focus on technology
							initiatives in tax & accounting departments. In my work, I combine
							my experiance as tax consultant and auditor with my passion for
							software development, innovation and technology.
						</p>
						<p>
							I hold a Master's degree in Business Administration from
							the University of Bern (Switzerland) and have more than 4 years of
							work experience as a tax consultant and auditor at Big 4 accounting
							firms. During this time, I was working on numerous client projects
							- both, as a subject matter as well as project management expert.
						</p>
						<p>
							When the whole world went into a lockdown in early 2020 due to the
							Covid-19 pandemic, I decided to use this situation as an opportunity
							to look into software development and IT systems. This decision was
							on one hand motivated by my interest in solving complex problems, on
							the other hand I also experienced during my professional work that
							the alignment between functional and IT workstreams is one of the
							most important and most challenging factors for the successful
							completion of major tax and accounting projects.
						</p>
						<p>
							After a year+ of self-studying, I enjoyed my new hobby so much that
							I decided to join
							<a href="https://hive.fi", target="_blank">Hive Helsinki</a>
							(a project oriented coding school, which is part of the 42 school
							network) in fall 2021. Since early 2022, I am working as a
							technology consultant and as lead developer for SimDec (cf. project
							section below) on my quest to bridge the gap between finance and IT.

						<h3>Hive Helsinki</h3>
					</summary>
					<img

						alt="Image of code example"
						class="project-image"
					/>
					<p class="project-description">
						<a href="https://hive.fi", target="_blank">Hive</a> is a new kind of coding school where students
						exclusively focus on hands-on coding projects. Hive is part of the <a href="https://42.fr",
						target="_blank">42 school network</a> and aims to prepare students to enter the job market as
						software developers.
					</p>
					<p class="project-description">
						The primary coding language, which is used at the school, is C. A key concept of 42 schools is
						that students are not allowed to use any libraries or functions that they have not coded themselves.
						This ensures that students obtain a sound understanding of coding basics such as memory management.
						Other skills, which are required to successfully complete the projects, are - amongst others - command
						line navigation, bash scripting, ability to develop algorithms / AI and a basic understanding of system
						administartion.
